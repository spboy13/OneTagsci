# OneTagsci
"OneTagsci" is an open-source project created as part of my Senior High School stay at Taguig Science High School. 

The project is an entry level ID and login system for students and faculty in an institution. 

The project uses an RFID sensor (controlled by arduino) and a microprocessor (Rpi 3b+) for data handling. 

Watch 'demoFinal.mp4' to see the full features.

Remarks:
  1. Upload "arduino_readRFID_sendToRPI.ino" file to arduino
  2. Visit "https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-arduino-serial-communication/#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20is%20to,Arduino%20IDE)%20to%20your%20board." 
      for info about arduino-rpi communication
  3. Make sure to have a working OS in your Rpi. Simply run the latest version of python script and everything should go well.
