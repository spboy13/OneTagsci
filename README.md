Remarks:
  1. Upload "arduino_readRFID_sendToRPI.ino" file to arduino
  2. Visit "https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-arduino-serial-communication/#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20is%20to,Arduino%20IDE)%20to%20your%20board." 
      for info about arduino-rpi communication
  3. Library for RFID scanner is included in the files. 
  4. Make sure to have a working OS in your Rpi. Simply run the latest version of python script and everything should go well.
